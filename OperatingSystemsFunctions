 One operating system function is providing updates. These updates often come in the form of an automatic update, depending on user settings, while others prompt you to approve the updates. Updates are essential to keeping your device running to the best of its abilities. 
Anoter operating system function is the sign in pop-up. I think sign-ins are particularly nice because if your computer ever gets stolen, or someone gets ahold of your computer that you do not want, there is a password prompt to keep others out. Password systems are evolving as there is now fingerprint scanning and facial ID included with the device. 
One last operating system function is the user interface. The user interface is generally customized to each personal user to make things more user friendly to that individual person. The userinterface often includes photo icons and general headings of what an icon is for.
